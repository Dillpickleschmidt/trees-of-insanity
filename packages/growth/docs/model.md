# Growth model and equation library

Reference for the retained Synthetic Silviculture math and its source model in Palubicki et al. 2009. The library currently develops one branch module; it does not orchestrate a whole plant.

## Module development

Implemented by `growth_rate`, `prepare_branch_module_prototype`, `make_growth_snapshot`, and `fully_grown_age`:

```text
Υ(u) = S((v̄(u) - v̄_min) / (v̄_max - v̄_min)) · g_p    Eq. 5
S(x) = 3x² - 2x³
da_u/dt = Υ(u)                                             Eq. 6
a_b = max(0, a_u - a_n)                                  Eq. 7
d_b = sqrt(Σ d_c²), terminal d_b = φ                     Eq. 8
ℓ_b = min(ℓ_max, β · a_b)                                 Eq. 9
τ_offset(a_b) = g₁ · ĝ_dir · g₂ / (a_b + g₁)             Eq. 10
```

`physiological_age_euler_step` preserves the paper's forward-Euler approximation of Eq. 6 without choosing a clock or timestep. Node age `a_n` remains provisionally derived from scaled root-to-node path length (ADR 0003). Existing module behavior is unchanged.

## Plant-scale equation functions

These pure functions preserve the paper math without architecture or stepping policy.

### Light and vigor

```text
f_collisions(u) = Σ_w V_intersect(B_u, B_w)               Eq. 1
Q(u) = exp(-f_collisions(u))
Q_accumulated(u) = Q_direct(u) + Σ_c Q_accumulated(c)      basipetal accumulation
v̄(u_root) = min(Q_accumulated(u_root), v̄_rootmax)
v̄(u_m) = v̄(u) · λQ(u_m) / (λQ(u_m) + (1-λ)Q(u_l))       Eq. 2
v̄(u_l) = v̄(u) - v̄(u_m)
```

- `collision_measure` calculates Eq. 1's raw cubic-meter intersection sum over every other module; see ADR 0006.
- `light_exposure` calculates direct light exposure `Q(u)`.
- Accumulated light includes each module's direct exposure exactly once; see ADR 0007.
- Mature modules divide direct exposure equally among terminals; occupied terminals add child accumulated light, and prototype branch topology carries the combined value toward the module root. Vigor traverses the same continuous network in reverse (ADR 0016).
- The root vigor budget follows accumulated light up to `v̄_rootmax`; see ADR 0009.
- `split_vigor` performs one binary Borchert-Honda split. Main-axis continuations are precomputed from prototype geometry using ADR 0010. Multiple laterals form one group for Eq. 2, then divide their shared budget proportionally by accumulated light using ADR 0011. An all-zero-light fork uses `λ` and `1−λ` directly rather than sending all vigor to main or producing `0/0`.

The earlier Self-organizing Tree Models paper applies the two-pass Borchert-Honda process to buds and branches. Synthetic Silviculture adapts it to branch modules.

### Morphospace selection

A new module's query coordinate is `(λ, D')`:

```text
D' = v̄(u_parent) · D / v̄_max
```

`vigor_scaled_determinacy` calculates `D'`. `nearest_morphospace_prototype` applies the accepted fixed grid (ADR 0005):

```text
 λ high | Cube.006  Cube.007  Cube.008
 λ mid  | Cube.003  Cube.004  Cube.005
 λ low  | Cube      Cube.001  Cube.002
          D low     D mid     D high
```

Each axis uses levels `{1/6, 1/2, 5/6}`. Determinacy increases across columns; apical control increases across rows. Maximum module vigor is the shared constant `v̄_max = 1`, distinct from `v̄_rootmax`; a root selection query uses full module vigor, making `D' = D` (ADR 0008).

### Orientation

```text
f_distribution(u) = ω₁ · f_collisions(u) + ω₂ · f_tropism(u)    Eq. 3
f_tropism(u_α) = |cos(α_tropism) - cos(u_α)|                    Eq. 4
```

`orientation_distribution_cost` and `orientation_tropism_cost` preserve these equations. Appendix A.1 describes coordinate descent from the parent orientation using perturbations `{[α_s,0,0],[-α_s,0,0],[0,0,α_s],[0,0,-α_s]}`. A new module is rigidly oriented once at attachment using its mature prototype extent against existing current bounds; later Eq. 10 tropism adaptation bends developing segments without rerunning module orientation (ADR 0013). Search uses the paper's four positive/negative perturbations of the first and third Euler angles, at most three iterations, and stops when no candidate improves cost. The perturbation angle is provisionally 10 degrees because the paper only specifies a small angle; it remains subject to result calibration.

### Attachment, shedding, and senescence reference

For a mature module, each terminal receives `q(n_i) = Q(u) / #n`. An occupied terminal adds its child's accumulated light and passes allocated vigor into that child; an unoccupied terminal attaches a child when its allocated vigor exceeds `v̄_min`. All eligible attachments commit together when the maturity-crossing step commits. Eq. 8 diameter support continues across parent-terminal/child-root attachments in one basipetal pipe calculation; shedding removes the child's contribution (ADR 0017).

The paper does not provide a numerical value for `v̄_min`. Growth, attachment, and shedding provisionally share `v̄_min = 0.02` in the module-vigor range `[0, 1]` until whole-plant calibration is possible.

At `p_t ≥ p_max`, the paper linearly reduces root vigor to zero with a constant step but does not provide the decline rate or duration. Senescence behavior remains deferred until healthy growth, attachment, light, and shedding are validated.

## Plant type parameters

The 16 presets retain Synthetic Silviculture Table 4 exactly:

| Paper | Field | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `p_max` | `plant_max_age` | senescence onset |
| `v̄_rootmax` | `root_max_vigor` | maximum whole-plant root vigor budget |
| `g_p` | `plant_growth_rate` | Eq. 5 scale |
| `λ/λ_mature` | `apical_control` / `mature_apical_control` | Eq. 2 and morphospace |
| `D/D_mature` | `determinacy` / `mature_determinacy` | morphospace |
| `F_age` | `flowering_age` | mature-parameter transition |
| `α` | `tropism_angle` | Eq. 4 target |
| `ω₂` | `tropism_weight` | Eq. 3 weight |
| signed `g₁` | `tropism_strength` | Eq. 10 strength/direction |
| `φ` | `terminal_thickness` | Eq. 8 terminal diameter; interpreted as centimeters and converted to meters |
| `β` | `length_growth_scale` | Eq. 9 scale; interpreted as centimeters per physiological-age unit and converted to meters |

`parameter_for_plant_age` selects young or mature values at flowering age. The paper's Eq. 10 `g₁`/`g₂` labels and Table 4's single signed `g₁` column are inconsistent; module growth retains the existing interpretation: the table value controls signed strength while per-segment falloff controls decay.

## Current reset point

The source interface currently retains module development and pure equation primitives; `PlantSimulation`, placed-module topology, traversal, attachment, orientation search, and plant snapshots enter through the accepted incremental milestones. The ADRs in this directory define their agreed behavior before implementation.
